[![Lint Python Code](https://github.com/ilDug/auth-app/actions/workflows/lint-python.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ilDug/auth-app/actions/workflows/lint-python.yaml)

**Backend Service** running on Docker Container, for managing users, accesses, accounts, permissions, privileges.

## Prerequisites

This backend service works as an API throught HTTP protocol.

It needs:

-   a certificate/key pair (RSA) to sign the JWT token
-   a mongodb database to store users and permissions
-   a proxy to expose the service to the network (like [traefik](https://traefk.com))

In the [lib](./lib/scripts) folder there are some scripts to help to create the inital configuration in order to pass them to `docker-compose.yaml`file. All configuration files are saved automatically to `lib/secrets/` folder. Feel fre to use another more secure system to pass secrets files to the container.

1. `lib/scripts/0.generate-credentials.zsh` creates credentials for MONGODB and stores it to `lib/secrets/` folder.

2. `lib/scripts/1.create-certificates.zsh` creates a cert/key pair and saves it in `lib/secrets/` folder.

3. `lib/scripts/2.create-email-config.zsh`creates an empty configuration that must be filled with a valid email account.

## Docker Container

To pull and run the Docker container, you can use the following commands:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ildug/auth-app:latest
```

Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your machine before executing these commands.

It needs also a **mongodb** database where to store the data of users, account, permission and logins.

Make sure to set SECRETS and ENVIROMENTAL VARIABLES for the container in the [`docker-compose.yaml`](./docker-compose.prod.yaml):
